# World_Weather_Analysis
Using Apis, python, Matplotlib, JASON

# Overview

The porpuse in this challenge was to be in contact with APIs specially, which are sets of information contained in servers from differents Companies, with many kind of information.  In this case, we were working with google maps APIs.

Having this type of info, we can apply coding methods to retrieve specific information, and re-create different analysis using it. This info can be imported in different types of files, like JSON, html, etc., in this way it easier to get access to the info. To have access to that info, those companies provide a Key, which is formed with a secuence of numbers and letters, in order to make the use more private, beacuse only the owner can have it, but with out sharing it, due people can used it for themselves, overpassing the credit provided for the Company and incurring in extra charges for its use.

Another think we were working on, was displaying maps images, which are provided in real time. For example, in this challenge, we show maps for some weather conditions, which had to be in real time  because we needed provide that info in order to take a decition about  suitable places for vacations.

Also we create a map containig a route, google maps gives the option to make it  "driving", "cycling" or "walking". This makes users to have a better experience in watching maps, info, routes, places near them or specifying the coordenates directly, of course programers have to make the plan to show out all the data convenient or required for users.

# Summary

We can conclude that using APIS is veruy useful, not so difficult, as programers there is a lor of practice to do in order to explode what APIS offer.
The manage of Data Frames is neccesary, as Numpy, the converstion between these type of Info and practice a lot.

I could say that is pretty important to know how to make reference to the files where the API key is imported, otherwise, your coding file just wont work and can take you many hours dealing with it. As well how to create .csv files ,how to read them, and how to create the path where you will have access to them.
